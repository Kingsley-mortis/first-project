            <p> Elizabeth I was a long-ruling queen of England, governing with relative stability and prosperity for 44 years. The Elizabethan era is named for her. Who Was Queen Elizabeth I? Queen Elizabeth I claimed the throne in 1558 at the age of 25 and held it until her death 44 years later. </p>

            <p> Elizabeth came to power in 1558, inheriting problems with religion, poverty and foreign policy. She became queen after both her brother, Edward VI (1537-1553), and her sister, Mary I (1516-1558), had died. Despite inheriting all of these problems she brought many strengths, ruled well and brought stability back to England. </p>

            <h2> <u>Golden Age </u></h2>
            <h3>When Elizabeth I took the throne in 1559 AD, England entered what many consider to be her Golden Age. England experienced a steep rise in international power and importance, a flowering of culture, and the Age of Discovery. Elizabeth re-established the Church of England and extended English influence in Scotland by supporting the Protestants. It was during the reign of Elizabeth I that William Shakespeare, the world’s greatest playwright and writer, lived.</h3>
            <p> Shakespeare’s works remain to the present day the most widely read and studied literature in the world.

                It was Queen Elizabeth that presided over a sharp increase in England’s ascendancy around the world, and of the start of an enormous colonisation campaign which would lead to the creation of the United States of America and the later British Empire.
                
                During her reign, British voyagers were at the forefront of the Age of Discovery, setting off in all directions to explore the globe, discovering many new lands.
                
                Elizabeth also supported the Protestants in the Netherlands, then under the yoke of imperial Spain.
                
                This triggered war between England and Spain, however, with the Spaniards dispatching an enormous invasion fleet, known as the Spanish Armada.
                
                The English navy, led by Admiral Sir Francis Drake, intercepted the Spanish Armada in the English Channel and after three days of fighting, the better trained English inflicted a decisive defeat on the Spaniards.
                </p>
                <p> By 1601 there were 20,000 slaves in London.

                    The presence of these ever-increasing slaves was too much to stomach for Queen Elizabeth I, who ordered that every last one be expelled from England.
                    
                    Queen Elizabeth I was fiercely patriotic.
                    
                    Once, when asked by Parliament about any forthcoming marriage prospects, she replied:
                    
                    I have already joined myself in marriage with a husband, namely the Kingdom of England.’</p>

        <div id = "Exploration">
            <h2> <u>Exploration </u></h2>
            <p> The reign of Elizabeth I of England (1558-1603 CE) witnessed an extraordinary spurt of exploration as tiny wooden ships boldly set sail from English shores to cross the world's oceans. Famous mariners like Francis Drake, Martin Frobisher and Walter Raleigh combined geographical curiosity with an insatiable thirst for the riches to be taken from foreign traders and indigenous communities.

                The period saw circumnavigations, numerous attempts to find the Northwest Passage, and England's first colony in North America. Exotic goods such as tobacco and spices were brought back to England which would have a lasting cultural impact. Above all, the success of the period encouraged British monarchs thereafter to entertain the idea of territorial conquest entirely independent of Continental Europe so that the medieval ambitions in France were replaced by post-modern dreams of a global empire. In this collection, we look in detail at some of the key figures in this process and consider the consequences of Elizabeth I's interest in sponsoring expeditions with the overlapping aims of trade, privateering and colonialism. </p>
            <h3> francese Drake</h3>
            <p> Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540-1596 CE) was an English mariner, privateer and explorer who in 1588 CE helped defeat the Spanish Armada of Philip II of Spain (r. 1556-1598 CE) which attempted to invade the kingdom of Elizabeth I of England (r. 1558-1603 CE). Roaming the Atlantic and Caribbean capturing their treasure ships, the Spanish called Drake 'El Draque' ('the Dragon'). Partial to combining exploration with piracy, Drake famously circumnavigated the globe in his ship the Golden Hind between 1577 and 1580 CE. One of England's most celebrated seafarers and idolised in his own lifetime, Drake was witty but sly, generous yet cruel, both audacious and reckless, fiercely patriotic and almost always lucky - in short, the archetypal Elizabethan hero. He died of dysentery in 1596 CE on an expedition to raid the Spanish Main one last time. </p>
            <h4> 1587: The Raid on Cadiz</h4>
            <p> Philip's interest in England went back to 1553 CE when his father, King Charles V of Spain (r. 1516-1556 CE) arranged for him to marry Mary I of England (r. 1553-1558 CE). Mary's successor, Elizabeth I continued the Protestant English Reformation, and the Pope excommunicated the queen for heresy in February 1570 CE. Elizabeth was also active abroad, sending money and arms to the Huguenots in France and financial aid to Protestants in the Netherlands who were protesting against Philip's rule.

                The already tense relationship between England and Spain was made worse by Elizabeth's privateers. Capturing ships on the high seas or attacking colonial settlements was one thing but when Drake went a big step further towards full-on warfare and attacked Cadiz in April 1587 CE, relations plummeted to a new low. Cadiz was Spain's most important Atlantic port and Drake 'singed the king's beard' in his audacious attack. Sailing straight into the harbour and ignoring the cannons fired from the fortress, Drake's fleet destroyed 31 ships, captured another six, and again destroyed valuable supplies destined for Spain's Armada. After three days, Drake sailed on to Cape Vincent in southern Portugal and spent another two months causing havoc among Spain's ships along the coast and as far out as the Azores. Philip's long-planned invasion, what he called the 'Enterprise of England', was delayed by these setbacks, but he remained determined to conquer his number one enemy. Philip even gained the blessing and financial aid of Pope Sixtus V (r. 1585-90 CE) as the king presented himself as the Sword of the Catholic Church.</p>
            <h4> 1588 CE: The Spanish Armada</h4>
            <p> The Spanish Armada, a fleet of 132 ships packed with 17,000 soldiers and 7,000 mariners, sailed from Lisbon (then under Philip's rule) on 30 May 1588 CE. It was intended that the Armada would establish dominance of the English Channel and then reach the Netherlands in order to pick up a second army led by the Duke of Parma, Philip's regent there. The fleet would then sail to invade England.

                The Armada was commanded by the Duke of Medina Sidonia. England's fleet of around 130 ships was commanded by Lord Howard of Effingham with Drake as vice-admiral in his flagship the Revenge. The large Spanish galleons - designed for transportation, not warfare - were much less nimble than the smaller English ships which would, it was hoped, be able to dash in and out of the Spanish fleet and cause havoc. In addition, the 20 English royal galleons were better armed than the best of the Spanish ships and their guns could fire further.
                
                The Spanish galleons were spotted off the coast of Cornwall on 19 July. Fire beacons spread the news along the coast and, on 20 July, the English fleet sailed from its homeport of Plymouth to meet the invaders. There were about 50 fighting ships on each side and there would be three separate engagements as the navies battled each other and storms. These battles, spread over the next week, were off Eddystone, Portland, and the Isle of Wight. The English ships could not take advantage of their greater manoeuvrability or the superior knowledge of tides of their commanders as the Spanish adopted their familiar disciplined line-abreast formation - a giant crescent. The English did manage to fire heavily at the wings of the Armada, 'plucking their feathers' as Lord Howard put it (Guy, 341). Although the English fleet outgunned the Spanish, both sides found themselves with insufficient ammunition, and commanders were obliged to be frugal with their volleys. The Spanish prudently retreated to a safe anchorage off Calais on 27 July having lost only two ships and suffered only superficial damage to many others.</p>
                <p> Six fireships, organised by Drake, were then sent into the Spanish fleet on the night of 28 July. Strong winds blew the unmanned ships into the anchored fleet and quickly spread the devastating flames amongst them. The English ships moved in for the kill off Gravelines off the Flemish coast on 29 July. The Spanish broke formation still having lost only four ships but many more were now badly damaged by cannon shots and many anchors had been hastily cut in order to escape the fire ships. The loss of these anchors would be a serious hindrance to the manoeuvrability of the Spanish ships over the coming weeks. The Armada was then hit by the increasingly strong winds from the south-west. The Duke of Medina Sidonia, unable to get close enough to grapple and board with the flighty English ships and with Parma's force blockaded in by Dutch ships, ordered a retreat and abandonment of the invasion.</p>
                <p> The Armada was forced by the continuing storm to sail around the tempestuous shores of Scotland and Ireland in order to return home. A bad storm hit them in the Atlantic, and only half of the original Armada made it back to Spain in October 1588 CE. Philip did not give up despite the disaster of his great 'Enterprise', and he tried twice more to invade England (1596 and 1597 CE), but each time his fleet was repelled by storms.</p>
                <h4> 1577-80 CE Voyage of Circumnavigation</h4>
                <p> The idea to mount an expedition to explore what lay south of the equator and see if a great southern continent did really exist was first touted by Richard Grenville (1542-1591 CE) in 1574 CE. Grenville had failed to find backing for his plan as the search for the Northwest Passage took precedence, but in 1577 CE, Elizabeth turned to Drake for just such a southern voyage. Secretly, the queen invested in the project and instructed Drake not only to explore new trade possibilities but also to take whatever treasure he came across from the Spanish. Drake was given command of a fleet of five ships: Christopher, Elizabeth, Marigold, Pelican, and Swan. Mid-voyage the 140-ton Pelican would be renamed the Golden Hind in honour of Drake's principal patron, Sir Christopher Hatton, who had that device on his family coat of arms.
    
                On 13 December 1577 CE Drake set off with 164 men on what would turn out to be an extraordinary voyage; 60 of the men would never see England again. The fleet sailed down the coast of northwest Africa and then across the Atlantic route to reach the eastern coast of South America in April 1578 CE. At the southern tip of South America, the Christopher and Swan turned back while the other ships pressed on through the Straits of Magellan in August. Heavy storms in September meant that the Golden Hind continued the expedition alone to sail up the west coast of South America. Spanish settlements like Valparaiso were taken completely by surprise when an English warship showed up in Pacific waters. Several treasure ships were captured, including in March 1579 CE the Nuestra Senora de la Concepćion (aka Cacafuego) off the coast of Peru with its massive cargo of silver.</p>

            <h3> walter reigly</h3>
            <p> Sir Walter Raleigh (c. 1552-1618 CE) was an English courtier, soldier, mariner, explorer, and historian. A one-time favourite of his queen, Elizabeth I of England (r. 1558-1603 CE), Raleigh organised three expeditions to form a colony on the coast of North America in the 1580s CE. The colony was abandoned but the expeditions were notable for introducing tobacco and the potato to England. Unsuccessful at colonisation and falling out with his queen when he married one of her ladies-in-waiting, Raleigh turned instead to finding El Dorado, the fabled golden city of South America. Once more, success was elusive. Back in England, the adventurer was accused of treason by King James I of England (r. 1603-1625 CE) and imprisoned in the Tower of London for 13 years. Writing poetry and an important work of history, the beached mariner was improbably freed in 1616 CE to explore one last time South America. This final expedition was another failure and led once again to imprisonment. Raleigh was executed in the Tower in 1618 CE.</p>
            <h4> Virginia & the Roanoke Colony</h4>
            <p> Raleigh's early colonial career was more as an armchair traveller when he masterminded three expeditions to the New World without ever going in person. First, Raleigh acquired from his queen a six-year patent to create a colony in North America. The 1584 CE Amadas-Barlowe Expedition was formed to investigate what is today North Carolina, USA to see if this was suitable territory for England's first colony. Friendly contact with the Native Americans was made on Roanoke Island, and it did seem a fertile land with commodities available via trade such as skins and pearls.</p>
            <p> Raleigh organised his second expedition in 1585 CE and this time a small fleet captained by Richard Grenville (1542-1591 CE) carried a number of settlers, all men, and led by Ralph Lane (d. 1603 CE). Landing on Wokokan Island, the settlers then moved to nearby Roanoke Island but their provisions were limited and the Roanoke Indians were reluctant to trade with the Europeans as they had little surplus themselves. By the following spring, relations had soured and Lane attacked the Roanokans' village (perhaps as a preemptive strike), killing their chief. The settlers were relieved to leave for England in June 1586 CE when Sir Francis Drake (c. 1540-1596 CE) passed by on his way back from a raid in the Caribbean. Back in England, the showing of novelties such as tobacco and potatoes convinced investors to back Raleigh's plans for a third expedition to the land he had named in honour of his queen: Virginia.

            The 1587 CE expedition aimed to establish a colony for its own sake and not in order to form a base from which to attack Spanish ships in the Caribbean. Accordingly, the ships carried another group of settlers but this time included families, who were led by the experienced painter and cartographer John White (d. 1593 CE). White painted the colony, wildlife and Native Americans of the region, creating an invaluable pictorial record which still survives today. Hoping to settle in the Chesapeake Bay area, White was obliged by storms to settle again on Roanoke Island in July. The indigenous peoples had not forgotten Lane's attack the previous year and after the ships had sailed back to England, it seems likely the settlers were killed. The exact fate of the Europeans is not known as a relief ship could not be sent to them until August 1590 CE. No trace of the settlers was found except the word 'Croatoan' carved on a tree. This was the name of an island to the south but storms prevented any investigation at the time, hence the Roanoke Colony became known as the 'Lost Colony'. It was not an auspicious start for English colonial plans but it was a beginning and would be followed up with more successful expeditions in the 17th century CE; Raleigh had shown the way.</p>

                <h3> <u>naval supiriority</u></h3>
                <p> In the middle ages, travel was rare. However people still left their countries if they had to, whether it was for work, for war or for pilgrimage; and as sea travel was often dangerous, when people did travel, they went overland. Luxuries like spices and silk were imported to England from China and India by overland trade routes, which meant that supply relied on foreign merchants.</p>
                <ul>
                    <p> Then, in the 15th century came the first long sea voyages. These were made possible by:</p>
                    <li> new navigational instruments like the compass</li>
                    <li> fast, light ships that could be manoeuvred to catch the wind</li>
                    <li> the invention of guns</li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Naval power</h4>
                <p> The English navy grew, and English ships got better. English sailors become much better at sailing - and fighting - at sea. This didn't just improve trade and exploration - it was vital in defeating the attack by the Spanish Armada in 1588.</p>
                <p> By the end of Elizabeth's reign, England was the greatest sea-power in the world – and it stayed that way until the 20th century.</p>
                <br>

                <ul>
                    <p> Several English adventurers, notably Sir Francis Drake, were devout Protestants, and loathed the Spanish because they were Catholic. They took every opportunity to steal from them and attack their colonies.</p>
                    <li> 1572: Drake attacked Spanish ships loaded with silver from Peru and seized silver worth £20,000 - the equivalent of about £30 million today.</li>
                    <li> 1578 to 79: Drake launched successful attacks on Spanish settlements and ships in the New World, bringing back gold, silver, jewels and silk, making a huge profit.</li>
