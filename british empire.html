    <h1> The origins of the British Empire</h1>
    <p> The British Empire had its origins in the late 1500s.

        In 1585, Queen Elizabeth I gave Walter Raleigh permission to set up a colony on Roanoke Island, now part of the modern-day USA. The settlers had lost most of their supplies on the journey and struggled to find food when theirs ran out. They were at first reliant on local indigenous people for food, but there was a lack of trust between the two groups and the relationship descended into violence.
        
        All of the settlers’ attempts to set up a colony on Roanoke Island failed and they eventually abandoned the land in 1590. The first successful colony was set up in 1607 in Jamestown, which is now part of the state of Virginia in the USA.
    </p>
    <h2> why was the Empire built</h2>
    <ul>
        <p> there were several reasons for this</p>
        <li> to gain more money</li>
        <li> to gain more power</li>
        <li> to spread christianity and British ways of life</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Spain built its empire in the 1500s. It controlled 80 per cent of the world’s silver because it conquered several colonies in Latin America, such as Peru and Mexico. England wanted the money and power that the Spanish had, but this would require a lot of violence and force.</p>
    <p> The indigenous people in the new colonies were presented to the British public as <em>uncivilised</em>, because their way of living was different from that of people in Europe. This meant people began to believe that the British should continue to grow their empire to bring ‘civilisation’ to these places, even by force. There were also missionaries who believed it was their duty to travel to new countries and convert people to Christianity.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> The development of the British Empire</h2>
    <p> The empire existed for nearly 400 years in total. It spread from the Americas to include colonies in Africa, Asia and Australasia. During this time Britain lost and gained colonies.</p>
    <p> During the early years of the British Empire, 13 colonies in North America were established by the British. These colonies went to war against Britain in 1775 to achieve their freedom, declaring themselves independent on 4 July 1776. Britain formally recognised the United States of America as an independent country in 1783.</p>
    <p> After losing the 13 colonies Britain did not want its empire to shrink again, and decided to make it even bigger.</p>
